# Edge Apps

- Edge Apps is a framework for building and running content Screenly's digital signage screens.
- Edge Apps allows you to build custom digital signage content without provisioning or managing servers.
- You could think of it as something similar to other serverless technologies like Cloudflare Workers
  or AWS Lambda.
