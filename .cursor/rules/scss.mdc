### SCSS

- All Edge Apps written in Vue and TypeScript use SCSS for styling.
- While it's okay to use CSS, you should prefer SCSS whenever possible.
- Always use `rem` instead of `px` when specifying values like font size, margins, paddings, etc.
- Avoid using `!important` as it breaks the natural cascading behavior of CSS. Instead, use more specific selectors or leverage CSS custom properties (variables) for values that need to be overridden.
- Use CSS custom properties (variables) for theme values, colors, and other design tokens that need to be overridden.
- Do not add code comments to SCSS code unless it's not obvious what the code does.
