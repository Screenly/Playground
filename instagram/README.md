# Instagram Images Display

This is an example asset for Screenly as part of the [Screenly Playground](https://github.com/Screenly/playground).

Screenly has made it easy to display Instagram images on your screens by providing an HTML file template in the Screenly playground that can be easily cloned and modified to automatically fetch the latest images from an Instagram account and displayed as an image grid on screen(s).

Once the Instagram account is updated with new image posts, the images displayed on the screen(s) will also be updated to include the latest image post.

## Requirements
* A Screenly Account
* An Instagram account with media
* A Facebook Developer Account
* A command-line tool such as Terminal or an app like Postman that can perform cURL requests.

### Basic Steps
* Get an access token to autenticate against your Instagram account.
* Clone the HTML file to your local computer.
* Input your Instagram access token into the HTML code.
* The HTML file can then be added as content to Screenly and rendered on screen(s).
