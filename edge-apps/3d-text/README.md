# 3D Text Screensaver Edge App

A nostalgic homage to the classic Windows 98 '3D Text' screensaver. This Edge App creates a smooth, bouncing 3D text effect that moves across your screen, complete with metallic gradients and dynamic lighting effects.

## Configuration

The app supports the following settings:

* `text` - The text to display in 3D. If not provided, the screen name will be used.
* `color` - The color of the text in hex format (e.g. #9C5FE4). Defaults to Screenly Purple.
