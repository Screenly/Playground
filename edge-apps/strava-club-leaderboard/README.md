### Leaderboard Features

- **Rankings**: Athletes ranked by total distance in the selected time period
- **Statistics**: Each athlete shows:
  - Total distance covered
  - Total elevation gained
  - Average distance per athlete
  - Total time spent
  - **Auto-refresh**: Updates every 5 minutes
  - **Time Period**: Shows "This Week" or "This Month" based on settings

### Supported Screen Resolutions

The app is optimized for all Screenly-supported resolutions:

- 4K displays (3840x2160)
- Full HD (1920x1080)
- HD (1280x720)
- Standard (1024x768)
- Portrait orientations
- Raspberry Pi screens (800x480 and below)

## Automatic Token Management

The app includes robust token management to ensure uninterrupted operation:

- **Pure JavaScript management**: Token expiry is managed entirely in memory with no external dependencies
- **Proactive refresh**: Tokens are refreshed 5 minutes before expiry (when expiry is known)
- **Reactive handling**: If expiry time is unknown, handles token refresh automatically on 401 errors
- **Automatic retry**: If a request fails due to token expiry, the app automatically refreshes and retries
- **Zero configuration**: No need to set or manage expiry timestamps manually
- **Error recovery**: Clear error messages guide users to resolve authentication issues
- **No manual intervention**: Once configured, the app maintains itself without user interaction

This is particularly important for digital signage where the display may run unattended for weeks or months.
