# Committing Code to the Repository

## Committing Changes

When committing staged changes in Git:

- Use Conventional Commits for writing commit messages. Check [the Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for details.
- Use bullet points for the commit details
- If there are bullet points, keep them short and simple
- The commit message should be based on the staged changes, not on the recent prompts
