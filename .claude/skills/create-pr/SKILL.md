# Creating a Pull Request

## When Creating a Pull Request

- Use the GitHub CLI to create a pull request
- If GitHub CLI is not available, create the pull request via the GitHub MCP server if it's set up
- Use Conventional Commits for writing pull request titles. Check [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for details
- Keep the pull request description short and concise
- Automatically assign the pull request to yourself
- Mark the pull request as "Draft" until it's ready for review
