# Creating a Pull Request

## When Creating a Pull Request

- Must use the GitHub CLI to create a pull request
- If GitHub CLI is not available, create the pull request via the GitHub MCP server if it's set up
- Must use Conventional Commits for writing pull request titles. Check [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for details
- Keep the pull request description short and concise
- Must automatically assign the pull request to yourself
- Must mark the pull request as "Draft" until it's ready for review
