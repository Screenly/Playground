### Creating a new Edge App from the template

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure that you have the following installed before proceeding:
>
> - [Bun (1.2.2+)](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
> - [Screenly Edge App CLI (v1.0.3+)](https://github.com/Screenly/cli?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)

After installing `bun` and the Screenly CLI, run the following command to create a new Edge App:

```bash
cd edge-apps/
bun create --no-git edge-app-template <edge-app-name>
```

```plaintext
Created <edge-app-name> project successfully

# To get started, run:

  cd <edge-app-name>
  bun run dev
```

This will create a new Edge App with the name `<edge-app-name>` in the `edge-apps` directory.

> [!NOTE]
> Don't forget to update `README.md` and `screenly.yml` as needed.

You can now run the local development server with a single command:

```bash
cd <edge-app-name>
bun run dev
```

Follow the instructions in the `README.md` file of the new Edge App for more details.

### TypeScript Library

The Playground also offers an Edge Apps library that contains utilities for building Edge Apps including helper functions and reusable Vue components.
The source code is located inside the `edge-apps/blueprint` directory.

To install the library, run the following command:

```bash
bun add github:Screenly/Playground
```

This will install the latest version of the library in the default branch.

You can also specify a specific version or branch:

```bash
bun add github:Screenly/Playground#vX.Y.Z
bun add github:Screenly/Playground#[branch-name]
```

Details on how to use the library can be found in [this guide](/docs/edge-apps-library.md).
